# How to run Simi-song

Simi-song was programmed in Python, using Visual Studio Code and Anaconda Navigator. PySimpleGUI was used for the GUI. For the best chance of success, it is recommended that you use the same programs.

First, clone the GitHub repository into the desired folder. Then, run Anaconda Navigator and launch VS Code from Navigator. Open the folder with the repository in VS Code.

You may need to install PySimpleGUI by running `python -m pip install PySimpleGUI` (this is the command for Windows).

At this point, you should be able to run the program. Run the `src/gui.py` Python file. You will likely be presented with a PySimpleGUI prompt to agree to a license and either create an account or use a free trial. Agree to the agreement and then choose to either make an account or use a free trial.

At this point, it should work!
